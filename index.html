                I come from Guatemala, a country in Central America. 
                I've always loved being creative in an sorts of ways and Im always open to new experiences. 
                I want to be a designer, an animator and a visual efects designer and hopefully have a really good paying job in Canada. 
                I would love to become successfully enough to be recognise by the world and become a figure to those who want to do what want to do.

                    I graduated from Baskent Univercity in Turkey, and I got my Bachelor of Arts diploma in American Studies. 
                    I've learned all kinds of media and culture and also how to create a character and how to analize the characters and the characters inside the movies. 
                    I know popular culture and its elements, games, movies and animations, and now I also want to learn, how to use all 3D softwares. 
                    I want to become a 2D and 3D animator, game designer and visual efect artist. 
                    And when I get my diploma from Fanshawe college, I hope I get a 3D animation and game design job in Canada or in States.
