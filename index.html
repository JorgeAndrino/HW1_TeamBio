            <h3 class="bio">
                I come from Guatemala, a country in Central America. 
                I've always loved being creative in an sorts of ways and Im always open to new experiences. 
                I want to be a designer, an animator and a visual efects designer and hopefully have a really good paying job in Canada. 
                I would love to become successfully enough to be recognise by the world and become a figure to those who want to do what want to do.
